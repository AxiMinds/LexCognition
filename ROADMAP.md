#### **1.1 Text Analysis**
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Basic sentiment analysis using a custom-built model.
   - **Vocabulary Diversity**: Measures vocabulary diversity through unique word ratio and average sentence length.
   - **Language Complexity**: Evaluates the complexity of the text based on average word length and sentence structure.
   - **Authorship Detection**: Identifies whether a text is likely AI-generated or human-authored based on a scoring mechanism.

#### **1.2 Processing and Reporting**
   - **Text Processing Pipeline**: Processes text files, extracts relevant features, and provides analysis.
   - **Automated Report Generation**: Generates detailed reports including text analysis results.
   - **Style Morphing**: Applies stylistic changes to the text based on predefined parameters.

#### **1.3 Integration and Infrastructure**
   - **Integration with Visualization Tools**: Includes support for visualizing sentence length distribution and word usage.
   - **Logging and Debugging**: Incorporates logging (via Loguru) for tracking processing steps and potential issues.
   - **Test Suite**: Implements automated tests to ensure the functionality of core components.
